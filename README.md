Is and application that generates "Choose You Own Adventure" styled R-Rated horror stories.
All you need to do is, start a small webserver point it to public, plug in your OpenAPI key and you are good to go.

There are a selection of typical horror plots to choose and OpenAI will generate a story for you. It will list 3 options to choose from to progress the story.

The AI prompts are setup to be R-Rated. However you can of course change the prompts to be PG-Rated. This was initially created for my own, to get some horrific gross "Choose Your Own Adventure" horror stories. 
I realised that with kids, not reading as much as they should, this can actually be a good way to get them to read more. It combines reading with "screens" and interactive elements.
